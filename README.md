Requirements

Ceate a Python script that takes as an input an integer vector of length 11. Reorder this vector to simulate all possible mobile phone number combinations that mimic a number from Venezuela in a local format (ex: 0416 123 4567) using the following rules: 
- All existing 8s are next to each other 
- All 9s are separated from each other by a number which is unique in the vector 
- Two different numbers each appear twice in the vector and are separated from each other by at least one 8 (E.G: A-8-B or A-8-8-B, where A and B are different and appear twice each) ● All 3s are surrounded by the same number 
- Numbers in positions 5, 6, and 7 are divisible by the same number
- The number in the second last place is divisible by the one in the last place 
- The number in the last position is a prime
